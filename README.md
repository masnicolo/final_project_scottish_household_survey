### Scottish Household Survey (SHS)

##### I have analysed and interpreted the results of the SHS from 2012 to 2019. I have analysed the relationships between neighbourhood rating/ community beloning and access to green spaces. Finally, I built a logistic regression model predicting which households would have a higher rating and better access to green spaces. 

##### The findings were presented in a 10-minute presentation.
